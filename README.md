# custom-ai-agent

## Proposal
For my project I'm looking to create an ai agent that can generate different build paths for a player in league of legends based on the current state of the game/what their team, the opponent, and their current build have to offer.

## Requirements
General
I will be able to enter a players name and see their live game data
I will be able to get information about what that player is using
I will be able to recommend a build path based on information about the game
I will have the option to choose they types of builds recommended to me e.g. Agressive, Defensive, Greedy, etc
I will be able to recommend runes based on user entered informantion in the draft portion of the game
Settings for a players preferences in playstyle
Game data for recommended build, actual build, win or loss, and other player data will be stored on a database
Admin account will be able to look and edit at information for any player

Functions
I will have an autonomous function that runs at varius points in the game to check it's state and make build recommendations
I will have a function that will update the UI with a list of potential items for the user to build
I will have an autonomous function that will check which players are at their strongest point in the game for their character
I will have a user confirmed function that will create a rune page that is most ideal based off of the character they are playing, the enemy team, your own team

Additional Tasks
For this project I will be looking to work with images of items and runes to help display information in the application
I would also like to experiment with a 3rd party MCP server

New things to do:
Working with a 3rd party MCP server
Working with live game data
